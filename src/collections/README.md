# Collections

Here are defined all the Mongo collections. The code is used on client and server side.

I have used the [simple-schema](https://github.com/aldeed/meteor-simple-schema/) and [collection2](https://github.com/aldeed/meteor-collection2) meteor package to define the collections structures and some defaults such as the owner of a document.

This folder also contains custom collections methods encapsulating some queries.
